# TwentyOne2015
This is the app for the 2015 Twenty-One Tournament.

As of right now, the idea for next year (2016) is to use the same app and just make updates to what's already in place. If anyone wants to contrubute, feel free to create a fork and do some work.

A couple notes:
- Everything is written in Swift so you'll need XCode 6 or higher to contribute.

- Before changing any scores or anything please set up a new Parse database so that we can keep last years tournament stats in record. Maybe it doesn't have to be a new database but just a new class in the current database or whatever. Key point here is please don't make any changes to current scores. I'll do this eventually but I just haven't done it yet.
